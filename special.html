    <h1>You're special to me. <span class="heart">‚ù§</span></h1>
    <p>
        You are the only one who I wouldn't mind losing sleep for,
        the only one who I can never get tired of talking to and
        the only one who crosses my mind constantly throughout the day.<br><br>
        You are the only one who can make me smile without any intention
        and affect my emotions with every action of yours. I can't explain
        in words how much you mean to me but you're the one I'm afraid of
        losing and the one I want to keep in my life.
